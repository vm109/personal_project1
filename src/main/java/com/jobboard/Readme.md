- jobboard uses listings from various sources 
- reads through each listing and sends a enriched version to a message queue for further processing
- i.e enriched message can be sent to a kafka topic
- from the topic a consumer can read the enriched message and store it to a index like elasticsearch for further searching and filtering
- from elastic search dashboards like kibana can be used to visualize the data
- May be a summary report can be generated and stored to a database like postgresql/mongodb for further analysis
